            <blockquote>
                <p>He who does not travel, does not know the value of men. (Moorish proverb)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                <strong>I am highly motivated and enjoy working at a fast pace, within a pressurised environment as this often yields the best rewards in terms of personal satisfaction. I also value the opportunity to learn new skills, with a strong appetite for knowledge.
                You will see from my application that at my disposal, I possess an armoury of skills and professional competences which I strongly believe are fundamentally critical to any job.
                I can effectively communicate technical and non-­technical information across to audiences with different backgrounds verbally and in writing with clarity. 
                It is important to highlight that I am also a skillful negotiator, often having to solve problems and bring people together to complete tasks.</strong>
